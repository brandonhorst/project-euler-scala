#Project Euler Solutions in Scala

The following are my solutions the Project Euler problems that I've attempted thus far in Scala.

**If you are doing Project Euler, please do not look at these** - the experience will be much more beneficial if you solve them on your own. If you are looking for resources, there are better options, many with comments and whatnot, by people far more experienced in the language.

This is simply a repository for my own code as I learn this language. The solutions mostly print a single integer which is the problem answer, except in a few cases when calculating an equation takes less time than writing a program to do it. Many of them could be optimized further and be written more readably, my focus is getting a solution in a way that is at least vaguely Scala-esque.

If you are really bored and want to give me advice, feel free to submit an issue.

Thanks!
